# sed-project
This is a project I did with one of Professor George Smoot's (yes the Noble price winner!) graduate student to try to obtain star formation rate (SFR) from the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of a certain galaxy. However, in this case I just used a data example.

The graduate student want this project to be used when JWST has finally launched and obtain crucial observations.

\* When importing the library, make sure to run it twice to get rid of the weird graph that pops up when you run it the first time.
